## Dev

- [@DrazoxXD](https://www.github.com/drazoxXD)


## Features

- fully built with ox scripts (target,lib,oxmysql)
- optimised chat (from 0.04 to 0.00)
- customised pma-voice with radio animation
- 3 teams
- Basic koth hud (Not optimised)


## Optimizations

We were having problems with the chat opening so i rewritten/edited some stuff in chat client side mainly 'cl_chat.lua'!

From the createthread i deleted the check for button press on t or L and i wrote the ox_lib to open a menu on the L button and for T did the same thing but that just runs the function for opening the chat!



## Roadmap

- Better target support

- Make oxmysql now essential part for this!

- Create xp system were you can get more weapon kits for the ped if you leveled up or have high enough level!

- Rebuild the nd_koth script so you can config everything!

- Make maps for every team!

- Some kind of inventory when you buy weapon! (only 3 items! Like everry other koth server!)
